# Wind Energy Analysis Project

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on historical wind speed data from Met Éireann, the Irish National Meteorological Service.  
The aim of the project is to explore wind speed patterns and assess their potential relevance for wind energy generation in Ireland.

## Project Overview
The project demonstrates the key stages of a data analytics workflow:
- Acquiring data from an external source
- Cleaning and preparing the data
- Analysing wind speed patterns and trends
- Presenting findings using visualisations

## Repository Structure
- `wind_analysis.ipynb` — main Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis, code, and visualisations  
- `data/` — directory used to store the dataset(s) used in the project  

## Requirements
The project uses Python and the following main libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository to your local machine  
2. Open `wind_analysis.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab  
3. Run the notebook cells from top to bottom
